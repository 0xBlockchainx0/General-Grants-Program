# Web3 Foundation Grants

As part of our commitment to promoting the Web3 ecosystem, we are providing a comprehensive grants initiative. This means that successful applicants will be able to receive funding for their efforts to improve the Web3 ecosystem.

## Grant Application Types
There are two separate types of grant application:

* **Targeted** programmes where we ask for proposals, reach out, etc. Generally where the foundation is active. These will be done via:
  * Request for Proposals (RfPs)
  * Direct Outreach
* **Speculative** applications where the outside connects to us and asks if we want to fund them.

## Process
The grant application can be seen as a 5-step process. Below is an outline of these 5 steps.
  
1. Communication
   * See the list all of all programmes, bounties and RfPs (in a previous section).
   * If your idea isn&rsquo;t listed, but you think it&rsquo;s cool, you can send us an email or get in touch via Riot.
1. Application
   * Creating an application involves creating a pull request into this repository. There is a template for the application itself (a new file) and there is a template for the body of the pull request itself.
   * Please make a pull request into the appropriate folder: [Programme](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/tree/master/grants/programme), [Speculative](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/tree/master/grants/speculative).
   * The application template to be filled out (create a new file in the appropriate folder): [Link](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/grants/grant_application_template.md)
   * The template for the pull request body is here: [Link](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/grant_application.md)
   * Please take care to include all of the necessary information!
1. Review
   * W3F will review the applications received and determine if more information is required and potentially schedule a call with the team.
1. Decision
   * W3F will notify the applicants of whether their proposal has been accepted for grant funding or not.
   * If a team is successful, there will be further conversation required to figure out specific details around timelines and payment schedules.
1. Follow up
   * Once progress has started, W3F will want to have follow up conversations to see how the project is developing.
