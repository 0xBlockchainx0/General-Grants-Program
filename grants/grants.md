# Web3 Foundation Grants

As part of our commitment to promoting the Web3 ecosystem, we are providing a comprehensive grants initiative. This means that successful applicants will be able to receive funding for their efforts to improve the Web3 ecosystem.

## Grant Application Types
There are two separate types of grant application:

* **Targeted** programmes where we ask for proposals, reach out, etc. Generally where the foundation is active. These will be done via:
