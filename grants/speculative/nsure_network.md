# General Grant Proposal

* **Nsure.Network:**  Open Insurance Platform for Open Finance

## Project Overview

### Overview
Nsure is an open insurance platform for Open Finance. The project borrows the idea of Lloyd’s London, a market place to trade insurance risks, where premiums are determined by a Dynamic Pricing Model. Capital mining will be implemented to secure capital required to back the risks at any point of time. A 3-phase crowd voting mechanism is used to ensure every claim is handled professionally.

Nsure will include the following parts::
  * Nsure protocol: with full support for capital mining, buying, staking etc.
  * Nsure products: enable more and more financial applications(including smart contracts) to insure.
  * Nsure financial service app: integrate with selected Polkadot wallet, to provide full functions and good experience.

### Project Details 
For the project, we have finished a MVP on ethereum rinkeby network which can be found here: https://buy.nsure.network/#/insure, and the code could be found here: http://github.com/nsure-tech. In general, it has 3 parts: 

#### Open market to trade risk
Nsure tokens can be used to stake on the risks that Nsure token holders feel comfortable with. Insurance premiums are paid daily, and Nsure token holders benefit from the system and leverage provided.

#### Capital mining
By providing capital to the Nsure Network, Nsure tokens are minted and issued to the capital providers. Token holders can 1) stake on the projects and earn premiums; 2) hold to enjoy the benefit from the growth of the system; 3) sell in the market to realize profit.

#### Dynamic Pricing & Capital Management
Pricing is determined by real-time supply and demand. The capital model is used to ensure claims will be paid and that systematic risk is under control.


### Ecosystem Fit
Nexus mutual is the first player in the decentralized space. Nsure borrows the idea from liquidity mining to capital mining and use the capital to provide leverage of all policies sold. Dynamic pricing model will generate price quote based on demand and supply which fixed NXM's pricing model that is only based on capital supply. Staking model is much friendlier than NXM in terms of locking period, risk taking and leverage setting. Risk model takes lower leverage than NXM which protects both risk assessors and capital suppliers. Claim process is optimized to only one round of public vote which reduced unnecessary public vote steps. Policyholder will file claims together as a group instead of filing each case one by one.
