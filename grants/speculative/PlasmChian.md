## Project Description
Plasm Network is a scalable DApps platform on Polkadot. Originally Plasm is a set of Plasma Substrate Runtime Module Libraries that allows developers to add Plasma functions to their Substrate chain. We have published our white paper draft1. You can find further information from [here](https://github.com/stakedtechnologies/plasmdocs/blob/master/wp/en.pdf) 

Since we are making modules, we can also make a parachain by importing these modules. We aim to be one of the firstest scalable parachains once Polkadot is successflly launched. So what's new on Plasm network?  

With this grant, we plan to implement OVM, optimistic virtual machine on Plasm network. OVM is a virtual machine that is designed to support all layer2 protocols. The most important thing is that OVM can be a unification of all layer2 solutions. This means Plasm will be not only for Plasma but also for *other layer2 scaling solutions* such as *Lightning Network* and *Raiden Network* (State Channel). We try to implement all layer2 solutions on Polkadot. The potential is huge simply because Plasm network can handle many use cases like DeFi, gaming, and IoT with OVM.
