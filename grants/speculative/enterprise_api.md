# Enterprise Ready Polkadot API

## Project Description
We propose to add uniformity across Substrate APIs and to utilize well known interfaces called Database Abstraction Layers (DBAL or DAL). This will allow any Enterprise with widely used Frameworks such as Entity or Hibernate to pilot Polkadot usage in a few days, rather than weeks or months.

In addition, in the scope of this proposal are the robust, Enterprise level Indexer and a Consensus Insurer, which will greatly improve security and reliability of applications that work with Polkadot.

## Development Roadmap
Project roadmap and financial plan will be shared privately via Google Form.

Long term plans start with developing APIs for all mainstream languages as well as in-depth API improvement. As Polkadot community high level usecases evolve, API will adapt.

Also, our team plans to implement broader spectrum of applications such as
* Decentralized Non-Fungible Token Exchange
* Multi-chain token issuance
* Cross-chain Payment Gateways
* etc.
