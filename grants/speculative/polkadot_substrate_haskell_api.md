# Polkadot Substrate Haskell API

## Project Description

We are building a Haskell API for Substrate and Polkadot. It will enable developers to read chain information, state, and block details, as well as sign and publish transactions via Haskell. This will also include a subscription API to connect to substrate nodes’ websocket endpoints and receive real-time data updates. A core feature of the API will be code generation tools for API metadata, providing type-safe interaction with any substrate node.
Haskell is a statically typed, purely functional programming language that is great for building type-safe, performant programs quickly and reliably. Haskell’s active developer community and outright advantages as a language make it a valuable addition to the Polkadot ecosystem.

By combining Template Haskell, a DSL for auto-generating Haskell code, with the API metadata, clients for any substrate API can be generated. Developers can easily interface with these APIs without burdensome boilerplate.

We’re interested in this because we’re designing a parachain for non-fungible token metadata. We aim to solve the problem of metadata stored in central locations, such as a company’s own IPFS node, or private servers. Our parachain gives owners of NFTs the ability to also take ownership over the metadata, rather than relying on a trusted third party to host it.

## Team's experience

The Pixura team has been building in the Ethereum and distributed systems space for several years. In 2018, they launched the NFT exchange [SuperRare.co](https://superrare.co), one of the most active collectibles projects on Ethereum. They also launched [platform.pixura.io](https://platform.pixura.io), a generalized tool to create P2P digital item marketplaces on Ethereum.
The Pixura team has deep knowledge of distributed/decentralized applications, Haskell, Solidity, IPFS, and Ethereum, including open source contributions to [hs-web3](https://hs-web3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [Haskell Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/f-o-a-m/hs-abci). Short background on individual team members is below.

Charles Crain will be the principal engineer leading development . He has worked in the Ethereum space for 4+ years, and has a diverse background in distributed systems. He worked extensively on a Haskell Ethereum node implementation as well work on JP Morgan’s Quorum. Charles designed and built the Ethereum indexer which feeds the data pipeline powering SuperRare and Pixura Platform. He is a frequent open source contributor, including work earlier this year on the Haskell implementation of Cosmos’ SDK.

John Crain will be an engineer working on the project, focusing on design and architecture, and will be the main point of contact for the grant application. John has been in the blockchain space since 2015, when he joined NYC-based ConsenSys as a product engineer, and later was a founding member of enterprise Ethereum platform BlockApps.

Jonathan Perkins will be an engineer on the project and will be in charge of project management and coordination. Jonathan is a full stack engineer with a background in product management. At Pixura, Jonathan has served as head of product, leading UI layer engineering and product strategy. Prior to co-founding Pixura, he worked as a software engineer at Reaktor, a global technology consultancy.
