# Vue.js ui utilities, components and libraries

## Project Description

Reimplement [React components](https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui) into Vue.js for broader ecosystem. Vue.js is mostly adopted in Asia. It will enable access for Vue.js developers to build Polkadot/Substrate apps on top of Vue.js using https://polkadot.js.org/ui/ and https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/

We are interested in UI components (ordered by interest)
* https://github.com/polkadot-js/ui/tree/master/packages/ 
* https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/tree/master/packages/ app-*
* https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/tree/master/packages/ui-signer
* https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/tree/master/packages/ui-app

### Reasons
Vue.js has easier learning curve to get productive and less head scratching even for backend engineers used to write code in Node.js
Vue.js aims to be easier onboarding for full stack engineers to build frontend tools

### Intended language of development
Implementation would be in Vue.js 2.6.x, Typescript 3.5.x in modern way using ES6/7/8 covered with tests covered up to 60% with [A maintainability by codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/polkadot-js/ui).

## Why our Team is Interested
We want to be part of community and Polkadot ecosystem by building solid basestone for further projects.

Nowadays https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps repository have 510 closed various issues and 48 open. 
Frontend is emerging component for decentralization ecosystem and probably looking forward to support repository as well
