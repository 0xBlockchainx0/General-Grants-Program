# Project name
Open Square Network

## Project Description
Open Square Network is a blockchain based crowdsourcing and reputation platform. It will be implemented as a para-chain
of Polkadot. We aim to attract thousands of middle and small sized enterprises and millions of developers in China for the first phase. 
This platform is a trial to evolve the human resource market. First phase features include:
- Bounty funders can fund a bounty, while hunters can apply it.
- Funders can mining powers by successful collaboration with hunters.
- Reputation of both funders and hunters will be calculated based on the finished bounty and remarks.
- Aim to maintain relatively long collaboration between bounty funders and hunters.
- Platform fairness and transparency will be provided by on-chain governance.

## Development Roadmap
`The Open Square Network MVP` will be a 3-month project, aiming to deliver a testnet based on Substrate which support basic business for bounty founders and hunters.

* **M1: Economic/reputation model, governance design, technical design (2 weeks)**
  - We will create and publish relevant documents and whitepapers.
  - Design the native currency distribution model for chain participators(validators, bounty funders and hunters).
  - Design stable currency bridge mechanism(maybe trustee for first phase).
  - Technical specifications and modules design.
  - DApp UX design.
  
* **M2: Implementation of the runtime modules (1 month)**
  - Native asset module, which will support transfer, staking, election, while chain dividends amount will be decided by native asset holdings.
  - Stable coin bridge. Lock USDT/DAI on Ethereum, issue them in Open Square Network, and the reverse operations, while stable coin will be
  mainly used for bounty funding.
  - Bounty management module.
    1. Funders create bounty with USDT/DAI deposit to it.
    2. Chain council will give some feedback and do some management for the bounty.
    3. Hunters apply and resolve it.
    4. Hunters get funding and Council can get some management fee.
    5. Successive mining powers will be assigned to Funders(maybe also to hunters).
  - Reputation module mainly manage funders and hunters' reputation based on the collaboration remarks.
  - Governance module involves council election and proposal management.
  
* **M3: Implementation of the DAPPs, explorer and user manual (6 weeks)**
  - A DAPP will be delivered to facilitate bounty funders and hunters to finish the basic business.
  - Other DAPPs like simple governance and stable coin bridge management will be delivered.
  - The chain explorer will be provided for blocks/extrinsic explorer.
  - The testnet will be launched with the DAPPs and explorer.
  - User manuals will be provided.
  

## Future Plans
* Multiple cross chain asset will be involved as bounty currency.
* More PR work will be done to attract bounty founders and hunters.
* Our vision is to build a new block chain human resource platform involve crowdsourcing, reputation building, recruitment.

## Additional Information
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:
* What work has been done so far?  
  1. We have drafted the basic economic model. More details about the model and technical specifications will be done in future work.
  2. We have enough experience with Substrate for development of [ChainX](https://github.com/chainx-org). 
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?  
No
* Have you applied for other grants so far?  
No
* Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?  
Some of our ideas are inspired by [Gitcoin Bouties](https://gitcoin.co/bounties/funder). Main differences are:
  - Open Square Network will support relatively long time collaboration between bounty funders and hunters.
  - A separate Polkadot para chain will be developed to support the business and reduce the friction for users.
  - Bounty funders and hunters can get financial reward by mining.   
  - Both the reputation of funders and hunters will be built.
  - On-chain governance will be built to provide more fairness and transparency.
