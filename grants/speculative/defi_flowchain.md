# Flowchain by Laminar
Laminar is a DeFi protocol company providing open finance building blocks such as stable currency and margin trading protocols. Flowchain is one of the focusing R&D projects. 

## Project Description
We are building a high throughput low cost specialised trading parachain for Polkadot using Laminar's Flow Protocol. We have been R&D our protocol on Ethereum, and ultimately we aim to bridge the on-and-off ramp trading experience with the scale and speed needed, hence we are extending our R&D to Polkadot and substrate. We already have high networth customer base to tap into for our intended Ethereum mainnet launch, and we believe this will accelerate adoption and bring meaningful transactions to Polkadot and the DeFi industry in general.

Flowchain will include the following parts:
  * Flowchain parachain: with synthetic asset protocol as base building block, a DeX for traders, lenders and risk takers.
  * Flowchain SDKs: to empower developer community to build and integrate financial applications.
  * Flowchain financial service app: integrate with selected Polkadot wallet, to provide friendly experience for various uesr groups.

He has also built various partnership including fiancial institutes to support Laminar's mission.

* Bryan (his github handle `xlc` should be very familiar to you) is a core contributor to substrate codebase, a Polkadot community ambassador, and substrate/polkadot lecturer at `YiKuaiLianXi`. He has extensive experience as a full-stack developer, and was previously blockchain architect at Centrality.ai leading charge of core blockchain and associated services development (https://github.com/cennznet). He graduated from University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Engineering specialising in Software. 

* Bette has more than a decade product/program/project management experience (with various company awards) in software and high-tech industry. She was previously Product Manager at Centrality, led development of PoS public blockchain, various protocols including dex, identity & permission, asset management etc and built decentralised ecosystem (https://github.com/cennznet, https://cennznetdocs.com/, https://www.onfinality.io/).

## Development Roadmap
MVP Flowchain will be a 3 month project, with the following milestones

* M1: R&D protocol design and verification based on work has been done for Flow Protocol (2 weeks)
* M2: Implementation of runtime modules of synthetic asset and DeX protocol (3 weeks)
* M3: Implementation of price oracle and other features (2 weeks)
* M4: UI Design & SDK (2 weeks in parallel as above)
* M5: Implement Flowchain financial service app (4 weeks)
* M6: Integrate all parts, liqudity injection and dry run (2 weeks)

## Additional Information
* Work has been done so far
1. We are drafting and verifying various aspects of the Flow Protocol, which will be the basis for the Flowchain. 
2. We are implementing PoC on Ethereum.
3. We are already very experienced with substrate development, example previous substrate work (https://github.com/cennznet/cennznet).

* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
All the work so far is funded by Laminar. We want to extend our R&D to Polkadot platform for reasons mentioned above, hence this grant application.

* Have you applied for other grants so far?
No.

* Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?
Akropolis on Polkadot, but they focus on informal economy. On Ethereum, in the likes of Market Protocol (for derivative trading), DyDx (for margin trading), MakerDAO (as lending provider) etc.
Liquidity is a common challenge in this space. We believe we have a new approach to liquidity provision with new game theory and ability to bridge on-and-off ramp players. As for MakerDAO, they will be our partner on Ethereum, and we will provide complimentary services to it.
