# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Listen

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

Listen is a voice social software based on data decentralized storage technology and blockchain technology.

### Overview

  - Listen is based on decentralized data storage technology and Polkadot of the underlying Substrate block chain framework to build the voice of social software, Listen tokens LT let each user can have part of the social network, at the same time will no longer be centralised collect user privacy data, using the federated learning training model of AI, the trusted computing privacy benefits for the user. Listen will launch its own main chain after the Polkadot's parachain has started.
  
  - Listen group DAO module and how to manage the relationship of members in the group. 
  
  - We want the voice social will run in the Apple Watch and Airpods. We want the voice social network will share by all users.

### Project Details 

Listen as a voice of social software, it is different with other communication tools, and podcasting software is also different, social support acquaintances, including voice, images, text and video, such as social practices, and social group in a stranger, using a similar round table in the form of BBS, group manager invited several guests, they have speaking right, and join hands to Listen and speak to the rest of the room, at the same time also can use the LT token to buy the speaking time, all purchases will accumulate in the room below. Listen creates a unique experience that is different from a Feed stream. In a community of strangers, celebrities engage in voice discussions and audience interactions around topics.

If the discussion in the room starts to decline and more and more LT COINS are accumulated, anyone can initiate a proposal to dissolve the room, and everyone in the room can vote on it. Once passed, the room can be dissolved, and the accumulated LT COINS will be divided equally among all the people in the room
after deducting platform fees.

The rules for dissolution are also very simple. Dissolve the room in one of the following two cases:
	
- half of the dissolution vote.
- (to vote disband - to vote against disband) over 20%.
	
When creating a room, group manager can set free access or paid access. In the case of paid access, 10% of the user's payment belongs to group manager (5% goes directly to group manager, the remaining 5% to group manager after the group is dissolved), 50% stays in the room, and 40% goes to the Treasury.Creating a group costs LT, depending on the size of the group, and the price can be governed through the council chain.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 


### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 6 month
* **FTE:**  5-8
* **Costs:** $15,0000

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate main Chain | We use Substrate to build the economic model of Listen, and how to play group DAO. |  
| 2. | Listen APP | We will concentrate a lot of energy on the development of IOS-level experience APP, as a cool voice social software, will bring different from the current mainstream social software.|  
| 3. | Listen Apple Watch APP | Listen introduces voice social networking to smaller devices, Apple Watch and Airpods. Listen positioning will be the best social software on Apple Watch. |  
| 4. | Introduce the first batch of internal beta users | Test in existing communities. |  
| 5. | Open Beta | Public testing after launching the mainnet |
