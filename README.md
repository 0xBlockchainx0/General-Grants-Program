# Web3-collaboration
This is a public repository to help coordinate our collaboration efforts with teams working in the Web 3 ecosystem. In order to build a better web, the Web3 Foundation will help to coordinate the efforts of teams working towards this common goal. The coordination of efforts will include helping to connect teams, cross-promote the products and protocols, as well as provide strategic grants when possible.

Our view is that the Polkadot platform will play a pivotal role in the Web 3 ecosystem. To get a better idea of how we think the ecosystem looks, we invite you to look at our proposed [Web 3 tech stack](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-wiki/wiki/Tech-Stack).

## About us - Web3 Foundation
For more information about the Web3 Foundation please visit the ["About Us"](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-wiki/wiki/Web3-Mission-and-Background/_edit) page on our wiki. 

## How this repo will be used
In this repository, we will facilitate collaboration via issue tracking. Essentially, the problems and ideas which we believe to be important will appear on the [issues](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues) page. It is also possible for project teams to suggest new ideas: to do so simply create a new issue.


## Polkadot ecosystem issues
Here are some of the important issues that we would love for the community to collaborate with us on:

Build Core technology:
* [Write and implement new parachains](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/11).
* [Create an alternate implementation of Substrate in another language](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/12) (e.g. C++, Go).
* Create alternate implementations of the Polkadot nodes (validators, collators) in another language (e.g. C++, Go).

Test core technology:
* Test the available code by building nodes: e.g. [PoC2](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/13).
* Test the available user interfaces and interact with the network.
* Help to find bugs and security vulnerabilities.

Create general ecosystem components:
* [Create a block explorer](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/8).
* [Create a node explorer](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/9).
* [Create a wallet](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/10).

Polkadot meetups:
* Organise meetups worldwide.
* Collaborate and help to organise joint meetups / workshops.


## Web3 ecosystem issues
The issues in this section will be better defined in the future. However, to gain an understanding of how we view the Web 3 ecosystem we suggest looking at our proposed [tech stack](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-wiki/wiki/Tech-Stack). We are keen to speak with teams working towards making the [Web 3 vision](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-wiki/wiki/Web3-Mission-and-Background) a reality.

## Who we are looking for
The ideal candidates are people who can work in a self-directed manner and are able to manage their own time and resources in order to hit the necessary targets. For meetups, it is possible to do this single-handedly although for larger coding projects we expect teams of multiple members will be typical.

The Web3 Foundation is here to provide guidance and cross-team coordination, and in some cases we will be able to provide funding too.

If these issues are of interest to you then please comment on an open issue, or create a new issue, and provide the relevant information (refer to the submission process guidelines).

## Submission process guidelines
To help collaborate with us to build the next generation of the web we would be grateful if you could supply the information listed below about you and your team (where applicable). In cases where funding is also required please add information that pertains the additional points listed below.

### Testing requirements
If you want to test our software then there aren't really any requirements, just download and have fun. Obviously, we would greatly appreciate constructive feedback and any heads up on bugs that you might find.

### Development requirements
If you would like to develop a new parachain or write an alternative implementation of our software, then we would appreciate if you contacted us and have a chat. While it isn't a strict requirement to contact us, we think there is a lot to be gained from having discussion and working together. The following list is a typical set of requirements that we would like to know about you and your team.

Please provide:
* Name (lead person), plus team members' names (if relevant)
* Send us an email with the relevant members CC'ed
* GitHub links
* LinkedIn profile links
* Brief description of team's background
* Project Name
* Website
* Project description (brief)
* Project plan/roadmap with relevant milestones

If funding is required, please indicate:
* Plan for use of funds
* Total previous project funding


### Polkadot Meetups
The plan is to have multiple active meetup groups across the world. We have put more information into the following doc: [Link](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/meetups.md). You are welcome to note your interest in the [issues](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues) section of this repo, but we also invite interested people to follow the link (below) to our meetup application form and provide us some basic contact details plus information about the type of meetup you intend to create:
